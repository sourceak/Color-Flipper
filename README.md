The color switcher

When the switch button is clicked, it switches randomly to any color using (r, g, b) 

The Primary button does nothing more than switch between red, green, and blue.

There is a select at the top left corner. This lets you pick a shade between red, green, and blue. Once you have chosen, click the switch button.
You will only see colors in the shade you have picked. You can go back to random colors when you choose the --- Please select --- from the selector.

There is also a save button. If at any moment you see a color you like, just hit save, and it will be listed to the right. If you don't want it saved anymore,
just hit the X next to it. 

The objective is for the user to hit the switch button repeatedly. When they see a color they like, they hit save.
